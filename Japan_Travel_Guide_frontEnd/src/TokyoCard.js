In fact, this sophisticated one-kilometer strip has some of the highest real estate prices in the world. Nearby, Yurakucho has even more high end shops and izakaya restaurants. ",

        p1:"Roppongi  is arguably Tokyo's most popular nightlife district, particularly for overseas visitors. From disco in the '70s to EDM today, Roppongi's nightclubs welcome anyone and everyone looking to drink and dance.  Unlike some other entertainment districts in Tokyo, Roppongi  has a large collection of restaurants, bars, and clubs that cater specifically to the expat community: Geronimo Shot Bar and Sheyda Bar, along with nightclubs Maharaja, MUSE, V2, and Odeon to name just a few. If you'd prefer a show to dancing, Roppongi  is also home to many cabaret clubs such as Tantra and Burlesque Tokyo.",
        p2:"Wherever you go, the neighborhood's streets are filled with off-duty military personnel, foreign business types, and young people looking to party. Keep an eye out for touts on the streets trying to pull you into their clubsâ€”these places tend to charge exorbitant door fees and exploit tourists.",

        p2:"Ueno Park  has a lake you can cruise around on, a forest, and an art museum and gallery. From its origins as the private grounds of Kaneiji Temple , through samurai wars, Imperial ownership, and today as a public park, Ueno Park  has remained a central gathering spot in Tokyo.",

        p1:"The origin of this striking temple is the stuff of legend. The story goes that all the way back in 628, two fisherman brothers pulled a statue of Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy, from the Sumidagawa River. Although they tried to return it to the river, it always came back to them. They built Sensoji to house this sacred statue and to honor Kannon, completing it in 645.",
        p2:"For centuries, a constant flow of visitors has come to pay their respects and pray in the temple's main hall. Around the central building, you can also see the Goju-no-To five-tiered pagoda, several smaller halls, and charming little gardens, one of which houses Tokyo's oldest stone bridge and wooden structure. To the right of the main hall, you will find Asakusa Shrine, where the three men who founded Sensoji are enshrined.",

        p2:"Despite its sometimes sleazy reputation, it is a must-see destination for young people and foreign visitors and is becoming more family-friendly. With over 4,000 bars, restaurants, clubs and convenience stores, there is a lot to choose from in such a small area. Oddities like the Robot Restaurant, a giant Godzilla, the Samurai Museum and Thermae-Yu baths have made it a popular attraction. Golden Gai, Hanazono Jinja, and even Koreatown keep people coming back for more.",

        p1:"The charm of the river walk is amplified tenfold in spring when the cherry trees bloom. Nearly every tree along the riverside explodes with cherry blossoms, forming a tunnel of flowers over the river. The mood is definitely celebratory, but while the river is considered one of the best places in Tokyo for flower viewing, note it's also one of the most crowded.",
        p2:"In the evening Nakameguro kicks its spring celebration into high gear. Lanterns illuminate the trees, and the entire stretch of the river becomes lively with festival cheer. Grab some street food, a sudsy beer and mingle with fellow visitors at one of Tokyo's most famous sakura-viewing hotspots. If the crowds become too much, escape to one of the many side streets for an artisanal coffee or craft beer.",
