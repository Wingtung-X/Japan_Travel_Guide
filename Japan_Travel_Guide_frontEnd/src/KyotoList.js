The temple's stage, supported by massive pillars, is one of the most famous images of Japan. But Kiyomizudera offers more than just a pretty view, with the experience of visiting beginning long before you reach the temple itself."

Tofu is warmed through in a simple broth made of water and kombu, and simple condiments are served alongside. Kyoto is the place to enjoy this, as it is the epicenter of Buddhist cuisine, in which yudofu features heavily."

Higashiyama in eastern Kyoto, is where the story of this ancient city began.With the completion of the sprawling observation deck in 2015, this relatively unknown spot offers unrivaled panoramic views. It is no surprise that Emperor Kammu came to this very location in the mid-eighth century to inspect the site for his proposed new capital. Satisfied by what he saw, Kammu ordered Kyoto's construction in 794."
